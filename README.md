This Repository has the files for the project titled as "INDIAN RAINFALL ANALYSIS".


This project has been made to showcase the power and importance of Data Visualisation & Analytics in today's era.


Here I have a dataset named as "rainfall_in_india_1901-2015.csv" which is a CSV(Comma Seperated Values) file, this file contains the rainfall/ precipitation data of different districts in India for all months and 4 seasons since the year 1901 till year 2015.


Further it has almost 4116 rows and 19 columns which can be seen after opening/ downloading the dataset.


The original source for this dataset is dedicated to KAGGLE and has the link as "https://www.kaggle.com/rajanand/rainfall-in-india"


Moving on to the main file that is the .ipynb (Juyter Notebook) named as "Indian Rainfall Analysis Project - Ayush.ipynb":


        This is an interactive python notebook that is having the python code and has the following data science libraries imported as:
        
                import numpy as np           
                
                import pandas as pd              
                
                import matplotlib 
                
                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                
                import seaborn as sns
                
    
        Further in this notebook we have imported the dataset and performed cleaning, grouping, cropping, merging, compiling, analyzed, processed &           visualized the data in the form of graphs and charts.
 
At last I have made a project report for the same named as "Report.pdf" which has all the necessary information about the abstract, certificates, introduction, table of contents, work, graphs & conclusion.

NOTE: If you wish to run the project on the local computer please follow the steps:


      1. Install ANACONDA from "https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual"
      
      2. Install the Jupyter Notebooks within Anaconda.
      
      3. Open Jupyter Notebook.
      
      4. In the home/dashboard go to the "Upload" in the upper right side of the screen & then choose the downloaded "Indian Rainfall Analysis 
      Project - Ayush.ipynb" file and upload it.
      
      5. Open the File from the list visible & then select "Kernal" from the above menu and then select "Restart and Run All" option from the  dropdown.
